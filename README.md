This is a small Scala program that recursively applies that 'last-modified' data from a source directory (program argument no.1) to a target directory (program argument no.2). It assumes the target directory is a sub-set of the source directory, i.e. it traverses the target directory and produces a `touch -r` using the correspondant source directory path.

THIS COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. Not knowing how to use this may damage your hard disk contents.
